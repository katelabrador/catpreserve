<h1>Our current family of Wildcats</h1>
<h2>We are currently housing four species and five wildcats</h2>

<p>These are our two tigers. We have a mother and her young cub who were rescued from a cruel breeder. The mothers name is Lily and the daughters name is Cocoa. </p>
<br>
<img src="palla.jpg" alt="a pallas cat" width="249" width="199">
<p>This is our Pallas cat. He was left abandoned in a shed without food or a way out. His name is Esponjoso (ehs-pon-hos-oh). 
<br>
<img src="cheetch.jpg" alt="a cheetah" width="274" height="384">
<p>This is our cheetah. She was rescued from a zoo that was closing down. She was treated humanely, but since she has no experience in the wild she will live out her days here. Her name is Felisa.</p>
<br>
<img src="serval.jpg" alt="a serval cat" width="350" height="362">
<p>This is our serval cat. She was rescued from a collector who went bankrupt and was no longer able to care for her. Her name is Dulce.</p>
